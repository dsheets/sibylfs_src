      under path [p] excluding [p] itself. It does not list the
      content of subdirectories. [p] is assumed to be a directory (not
      a symlink to a directory). *)

  (** [kind_of_path s p] returns the file-kind of the file
      identified by path [p], If such a file does not exist, or
      is not a dir, regular file or symbolic link, [kind_of_path]
      fails. *)
  val kind_of_path : state -> Fs_path.t -> Unix.file_kind

  (** [sha1_of_path s p] returns the file-size and the sha hash of
      path [p] in state [s]. If [path] is not a regular file,
      the function fails. *)
  val sha1_of_path : state -> Fs_path.t -> (int * string)

  (** [readlink s p] reads the symbolic link indentified by path [p]
      in state [s]. If [path] is not a symbolic link,
      the function fails. *)
  val readlink : state -> Fs_path.t -> string

  (** [atime_of_path s p] gets the access timestamp of the file
  identified by path [p] in state [s] *)
  val atime_of_path : state -> Fs_path.t -> string

  (** [mtime_of_path s p] gets the modification timestamp of the file
  identified by path [p] in state [s] *)

  identified by path [p] in state [s] *)
